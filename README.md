# Reproducible Research

The Genetics and Applied Genomics Laboratory is committed to promoting and using best practices to conduct reproducible research. This is very important as has been revealed that in the field of biology alone, over 70% of researchers were unable to reproduce the findings of other scientists and approximately 60% of researchers could not reproduce their own findings [Nature, 2016](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970).

In this repository you will find the data and codes to reproduce the research carried out on the following research articles:
