# Reproducible Research

The [Genetics and Applied Genomics Laboratory](https://genomics.pucv.cl/) is committed to promoting and using best practices to conduct reproducible research. This is very important as has been revealed that in the field of biology alone, over 70% of researchers were unable to reproduce the findings of other scientists and approximately 60% of researchers could not reproduce their own findings [Nature, 2016](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970). 

In this repository you will find the data and codes to fully or partially reproduce the research carried out on the following research articles:
